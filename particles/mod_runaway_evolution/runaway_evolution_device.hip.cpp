/* particles/mod_runaway_evolution/runaway_evolution_device.hip.cpp -- the
 * device launcher of the runaway-electron kernel.
 *
 * The per-particle physics is not duplicated here: re_project, re_deposit and
 * volume_preserving_push_jorek come from the headers the host arm uses. What is
 * here is the decomposition -- which thread does which piece of one step.
 *
 * One step is five launches, six when the group collides:
 *
 *   1. count_bins / scan_bins / assign_slots  -- a counting sort of the
 *      particles by element index, producing the run start and length of every
 *      element and the destination slot of every particle;
 *   2. jgx_c_scatter                          -- the move itself, every field of
 *      the record, driven by the descriptor;
 *   3. proj_stage_kernel                      -- thread per particle: the three
 *      velocity moments, staged;
 *   4. proj_accumulate_kernel                 -- block per element, thread per
 *      feedback cell: the outer product summed over the element's run;
 *   5. push_kernel                            -- thread per particle, in place;
 *   6. collide_kernel                         -- thread per particle, in place,
 *      only when the group asks for small-angle collisions.
 *
 * The collision is a launch of its own rather than the tail of the push: it
 * brings the Bessel evaluations, the L0/L1 table read and a second field
 * interpolation, and the pusher already takes every register sm_90 allows.  It
 * reads the momentum the push just wrote, on the same stream, and writes only
 * the momentum back.
 *
 * The point of the sort is step 4. A feedback cell is written by exactly one
 * thread, which sums every particle of that element into it, so the projection
 * carries no atomics at all -- where one thread per particle has every particle
 * of an element contending for the same n_degrees*n_vertex_max*n_tor*3 cells.
 * The sort is also what makes the push's field interpolation read a mesh
 * neighbourhood a warp shares.
 *
 * The particle order is restored before the download: the sort permutes the
 * device copy, and the host arm does not, so an `orig` index rides along and the
 * last scatter puts every record back where Fortran had it. A device build must
 * not be observable in the array that comes home.
